            <p>- Common Functions of Interrupts </p>
            <p class="oneSpace">- Interrupt transfers control to the interrupt service routine generally, through the interrupt vector, which contains the addresses of all the service routines </p>
            <p class="oneSpace">- Interrupt architecture must save the address of the interrupted instruction </p>
            <p class="oneSpace">- A trap or exception is a software-generated interrupt caused either by an error or a user request </p>

        <hr class="break">

        <p id="0119-Section3"><strong>- Chapter 2: Operating-System Structures</strong></p>
        <p>- Operating System Services</p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Operating systems provide an environment for execution of programs and services to programs and users</p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- One set of operating-system services provides functions that are helpful to the user:</p>
            <p class="twoSpace"><strong>- User interface</strong> - Almost all operating systems have a user interface (UI).</p>
                <p class="threeSpace">- Varies between Command-Line (CLI), Graphics User Interface (GUI), Batch</p>
            <p class="twoSpace"><strong>- Program execution</strong> - The system must be able to load a program into memory and to run that program, end execution, either normally or abnormally (indicating error)</p>
            <p class="twoSpace"><strong>- I/O operations</strong> - A running program may require I/O, which may involve a file or an I/O device</p>
            <p class="twoSpace"><strong>- File-system manipulation </strong> - The file system is of particular interest. Programs need to read and write files and directories, create and delete them, search them, list file Information, permission management.</p>
            <p class="twoSpace"><strong>- Communications</strong> - Processes may exchange information, on the same computer or between computers over a network</p>
                <p class="threeSpace">- Communications may be via shared memory or through message passing (packets moved by the OS)</p>
            <p class="twoSpace"><strong>- Error detection</strong> - OS needs to be constantly aware of possible errors</p>
                <p class="threeSpace">- May occur in the CPU and memory hardware, in I/O devices, in user program</p>
                <p class="threeSpace">- For each type of error, OS should take the appropriate action to ensure correct and consistent computing</p>
                <p class="threeSpace">- Debugging facilities can greatly enhance the user's and programmer's abilities to efficiently use the system</p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Another set of OS functions exists for ensuring the efficient operation of the system itself via resource sharing</p>
            <p class="twoSpace"><strong>- Resource allocation</strong> - When  multiple users or multiple jobs running concurrently, resources must be allocated to each of them</p>
                <p class="threeSpace">- Many types of resources -  Some (such as CPU cycles, main memory, and file storage) may have special allocation code, others (such as I/O devices) may have general request and release code</p>
            <p class="twoSpace"><strong>- Accounting</strong> - To keep track of which users use how much and what kinds of computer resources</p>
            <p class="twoSpace"><strong>- Protection and security</strong> - The owners of information stored in a multiuser or networked computer system may want to control use of that information, concurrent processes should not interfere with each other</p>
                <p class="threeSpace"><strong>- Protection</strong> - involves ensuring that all access to system resources is controlled</p>
                <p class="threeSpace"><strong>- Security</strong> - of the system from outsiders requires user authentication, extends to defending external I/O devices from invalid access attempts</p>
                <p class="threeSpace">- If a system is to be protected and secure, precautions must be instituted throughout it. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</p>

        <h2 class="sectionHeader">01/24/22 Class Notes - Continued</h2>

        <p>- Background services </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Launch at boot time, some for system startup, then terminate. Some from system boot to shutdown. </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Provide facilities like disk checking, process scheduling, error </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Run in user context not kernel </p>

        <p>- OS Design and Implementation </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Design and implementation of OS not "solvable", but some approaches have proven successful </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Internal structure of different OS can vary. Start by defining goals and specifications </p>
        <p class="oneSpace"><strong>- User Goals </strong>- operating system should be convenient to use, easy to learn, reliable, sage, and fast </p>
        <p class="oneSpace"><strong>- System Goals </strong>- operating system should be easy to design, implement, and maintain, as well as flexible, reliable, error-free, efficient </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Mechanisms determine how to do something, policies decide what will be done. </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- The seperation of policy from mechanism is a very important principle, it allows maximum flexibility if policy decisions are to be changed later </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Variations </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Early OS in assembly language </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Then system programming languages like Algol, PL/1 </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Now C, C++ </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Actually usually a mix of languages </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Lowest levels in assembly </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Main body in C </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Systems programs in C, C++, scripting languages like PERL, Python, shell scripts </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- More high level languages easier to port to other hardware but slower </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Emulation can allow an OS to run on non-native hardware </p>

        <p>- OS Structure </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- General-purpose OS is very large program </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Various ways to structure one as follows </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- MS-DOS written to provide the most functionality in the last space </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Not divided into modules </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Although MS-DOS has some structure, its interfaces and levels of functionality are not well separated </p>
        <p class="oneSpace"><strong>- UNIX </strong>- limited by hardware functionality, the original UNIX operating system had limited structuring. The UNIX OS consists of two separable parts </p>
        <p class="twoSpace"><strong>- System Porgrams </strong>- doing system level work as a standalone program </p>
        <p class="twoSpace"><strong>- The Kernel </strong>- low level stuff. CPU scheduling, memory management </p>

        <p><strong>- Microkernel System Structure</strong></p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Moves as much from the kernel into user space </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Mach example of microkernel. Mac OS X kernel (Darwin) partly based on Mach </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Communication takes place between user modules using message passing </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Benefits: </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Easier to extend a microkernel </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Easier to port the operating system to new architectures </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- More reliable (less code is running in kernel mode) </p>
        <p class="twoSpace"> </p>

        <p><strong>- Modules</strong></p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Most modern OS implement <strong>loadable kernel modules</strong> </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Uses object-oriented approach </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Each core component is separate </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Each talks to the others over known interfaces </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Each is loadable as needed within the kernel </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Overall, similar to layers but with more flexibility. Linux, Solaris, etc </p>

        <p><strong>- Hybrid Systems</strong></p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Most modern operating systems actually not one pure model </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Apple Mac OS X hybrid, layered, Aqua UI plus Cocoa programming environment </p>

        <p>- Operating-System Debugging </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Debugging is finding and fixing errors, or bugs </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- OS's generate log files containing error information </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Failure of an application can generate <strong>core dump</strong> file capturing memory of the process </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Operating system failure can generate <strong>crash dump</strong> files containing kernel memory </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Beyond crashes, performance tuning can optimize system performance </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Sometimes using <strong><em>trace listings</em></strong> of activities, recorded for analysis </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- <strong>Profiling</strong> is periodic sampling of instruction pointers to look for statistical trends </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Improve performance by removing bottlenecks </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- OS must provide means of computing and displaying measures of system behavior </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Windows Task Manager </p>

        <p><strong>- System Boot</strong></p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- When power initialized on system, execution starts at a fixed memory location </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Firmware ROM used to hold initial boot code </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Operating System must be made available to hardware so hardware can start it </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Small piece of code, <strong>bootstrap loader</strong>, stored in <strong>ROM</strong> or <strong>EEPROM</strong> locates the kernel, loads it into memory, and starts it </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Sometimes two-step process where <strong>boot block</strong> at fixes location loaded by ROM code, which loads bootstrap loader from disk </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Common bootstrap loader, <strong>GRUB</strong>, allows selection of kernel from multiple disks, versions, kernel options </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Kernel loads and system is then running </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Booting </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Modern hardware often uses UEFI (unified extensible firmware interfaces) rather than BIOS, as it provided better support for 64-bit systems </p>

        <p><strong>Chapter 3 - Processes</strong></p>
        <p>- Process Concept </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- An operating system executes a variety of programs. </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Batch system - <strong>jobs</strong> </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Time-shared systems - <strong>user programs</strong> </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Program is passive entity stored on disk (executable file), process is active </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Program becomes process when executable file loaded into memory </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Execution of program started via GUI mouse clicks, command line entry of its name, etc </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- One program can consist of several processes </p>

        <p>- Process Components in Memory </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- The program code, also called <strong>text section</strong> </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Current activity including <strong>program counter</strong>, processor registers </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- <strong>Stack</strong> containing temporary data </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Function parameters, return addresses, local variables </p>
        <p class="oneSpace"><strong>- Data section </strong>containing global variables </p>
        <p class="oneSpace"><strong>- Heap </strong>containing memory dynamically allocated during run time </p>

        <p>-<strong>Process State</strong> - As a process executes, it changes state </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- New: The process is being created </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Running: Instructions are being executed </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Waiting: The Process is waiting for some event to occur </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Ready: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Terminated: The process has finished execution </p>

        <p>- Process Control Block (PCB) </p>
        <p><strong>- Process Scheduler</strong> - selects among available processes for next execution on CPU</p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Maximize CPU user, quickly switch processes onto CPU for time sharing </p>
        <p>- OS Maintains scheduling queues of processes </p>
        <p class="oneSpace"><strong>- Job Queue </strong>- set of all processes in the system </p>
        <p class="oneSpace"><strong>- Ready Queue </strong>- set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute </p>
        <p class="oneSpace"><strong>- Device Queues </strong>- set of processes waiting for an I/O device </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Processes migrate among the various queues </p>

        <p>- Schedules </p>
        <p class="oneSpace"><strong>- Long-term Scheduler </strong>(or job scheduler) - selects which processes should be brought into the ready queue </p>
        <p class="oneSpace"><strong>- Short-term Scheduler </strong>(or CPU scheduler) - selects which process should be executed next and allocates CPU </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Short-term scheduler is invoked very frequently (milliseconds) </p>
        <p class="oneSpace"><strong>- Medium-term Scheduler </strong>- can be added if degree of multi-programming needs to be changed </p>

        <p>- Multitasking in Mobile Systems </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Some systems / early systems allow only one process to run, others suspended </p>
        <p class="oneSpace">- Due to screen real estate IOS provides for: </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Single foreground process, controlled via user interface </p>
        <p class="twoSpace">- Multiple background processes, in memory, running, but not on the display </p>
